# My Portfolio v2.0.0

Summary: The reason this is the second version is because I had a completely different layout before. I feel this is my most aesthetic website to date. This website focuses more on simplicity and showcasing my dev projects and skills.

Utilizing the following react libraries/services:

- Styled-components
- React-icons
- React-scroll
